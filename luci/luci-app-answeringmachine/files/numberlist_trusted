# Trusted numbers list
#
# This is a trusted numbers list.
# If the caller ID is in this list, answering machine does not answer even during sleeping time (i.e. your phone will always ring).
#
# * You can write one caller ID per one line.
# * You can write any comment in this file by specifying '#' at the beginning of the line.
# * You can also use extended regular expression (ERE) to specify many numbers at once.
# * However, '*' (zero or more times match) should be specified as '\*', '+' (one or more times match) should be '\+'.
# * Any other meta characters can be written as-is.
