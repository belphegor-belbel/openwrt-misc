# Denied numbers list
#
# This is a denied numbers list.
# If the caller ID is in this list, the call will be immediately answered and handled by this answering machine.
# But the content recorded by the answering machine will not be notified, simply discarded instead.
#
# * You can write one caller ID per one line.
# * You can write any comment in this file by specifying '#' at the beginning of the line.
# * You can also use extended regular expression (ERE) to specify many numbers at once.
# * However, '*' (zero or more times match) should be specified as '\*', '+' (one or more times match) should be '\+'.
# * Any other meta characters can be written as-is.
